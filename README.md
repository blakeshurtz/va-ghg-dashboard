# Virginia Industrial Greenhouse Gas Dashboard (`va-ghg-dashboard`)

A geospatial rendering pipeline for producing a dark-theme dashboard map of Virginia industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) facilities.

The project renders a single PNG map showing the Virginia boundary, reference layers (pipelines, railroads, roads, ports, incorporated places), terrain relief fetched from AWS Terrarium tiles, and per-facility icon overlays for reporting year 2023.

---

## What this project does

- Loads and validates runtime configuration from `config.yml`.
- Reads a Virginia boundary dataset and reprojects it for plotting.
- Renders a 16:9 map + right-side panel layout in dark theme.
- Fetches Terrarium elevation tiles at runtime to produce a multi-directional hillshade with hypsometric tinting.
- Overlays reference infrastructure layers (pipelines, railroads, roads, ports, places).
- Plots 2023 facility locations with subpart-based icons scaled by GHG emissions.
- Outputs a single PNG: `output/va_ghg_map.png`.

## Quick start

### 1) Create environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate va-ghg
```

### 2) (Optional) Generate smaller icon assets

```bash
python -m scripts.resize_icons --input-dir icons/original --output-dir icons/small --max-size-px 100
```

### 3) Render the map

```bash
python -m scripts.build --config config.yml
```

Output: `output/va_ghg_map.png`

## Configuration reference (`config.yml`)

### Top-level sections

- `state`: state code (currently `VA`)
- `render`: output sizing, DPI, theme, and output filename
- `layout`: map/panel width fractions (must sum to `1.0`)
- `paths`: boundary, emissions, icons, and reference layer paths
- `icons`: subpart-to-icon filename mappings
- `terrain`: tile zoom level, vertical exaggeration, tint strength
- `style`: map colors, alpha, line width, marker size, and extent padding

### Required keys (validated at runtime)

- `render`: `width_px`, `height_px`, `dpi`, `output_dir`, `output_png`, `theme`
- `layout`: `map_frac`, `panel_frac`
- `paths`: `va_boundary`
- `style`: `background`, `boundary_linewidth`, `boundary_alpha`

If configured, `paths.emissions_csv` must point to an existing file.

## Data sources

- EPA GHGRP FLIGHT Tool: https://ghgdata.epa.gov/flight/?viewType=line
- US Census TIGER Boundaries: https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2023/shp/

---

## Data expectations

### Boundary input

`paths.va_boundary` should point to a valid geospatial file readable by GeoPandas.

### Emissions input

The CSV referenced by `paths.emissions_csv` must contain lat/lon columns defined by:

- `paths.emissions_lat_col` (default: `latitude`)
- `paths.emissions_lon_col` (default: `longitude`)

Rows with non-numeric or missing coordinates are dropped during point conversion.

### Data dictionary (EPA FLIGHT cleaned output)

Primary table: `data/flight_cleaned_va_all_years.csv`

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reporting_year` | `int` | Reporting year for facility emissions. |
| `facility_name` | `str` | Facility name as reported to EPA. |
| `ghgrp_id` | `int (nullable)` | EPA GHGRP facility identifier. |
| `reported_address` | `str` | Reported street address. |
| `city_name` | `str` | City name (title-cased during cleaning). |
| `county_name` | `str` | County name (title-cased during cleaning). |
| `state` | `str` | Two-letter state abbreviation (uppercased). |
| `zip_code` | `str` | ZIP code stored as a string (padded to 5 digits when numeric). |
| `latitude` | `float` | Facility latitude in decimal degrees. |
| `longitude` | `float` | Facility longitude in decimal degrees. |
| `parent_companies` | `str` | Parent-company ownership string from EPA export. |
| `ghg_quantity_metric_tons_co2e` | `float` | Total GHG emissions in metric tons CO2e (negative values are treated as missing). |
| `subparts` | `str` | GHGRP subpart codes reported for the facility (uppercased, spaces removed). |

| `ghg_is_negative` | `bool` | Whether raw GHG quantity was negative before nulling in cleaned output. |

#### Cleaning notes

- Header rows are detected by finding `REPORTING YEAR` in raw worksheet exports.
- Source columns are normalized to `snake_case`.
- Numeric fields are coerced; invalid parses are set to null.
- Negative `ghg_quantity_metric_tons_co2e` values are nullified and tracked via `ghg_is_negative`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Config validation errors**: check required keys and section names in `config.yml`.
- **Boundary file errors**: confirm `paths.va_boundary` exists and is non-empty.
- **Emissions rendering errors**: verify `paths.emissions_csv` exists and includes valid lat/lon columns.
- **Import errors**: ensure dependencies from `environment.yml` are installed in the active environment.

---

## Roadmap (next sensible increments)

- Add panel content rendering (legends, metrics, labels).
- Add PDF export composition from rendered layers.
- Add automated tests for config validation and render smoke checks.
