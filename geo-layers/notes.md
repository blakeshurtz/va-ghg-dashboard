Perfect — now we’re getting into the layers that actually **explain why emitters are where they are**, not just where they sit.

From the layer catalog you shared, here are the **highest-value additions**, in priority order, with the exact layer filenames so you can pull them directly.

---

## ⭐ 1. **coal_fields**

**Why add:**
Coal supply still shapes plant siting in Southwest VA and historic industrial corridors.

**What it explains**

* Power plants near Appalachian coal seams
* Cement, steel, and legacy industrial siting
* Rail + coal + emitter triangle

**Expected overlap boost:** ★★★★★

---

## ⭐ 2. **above_ground_lng_storage_facilities**

**Why add:**
Natural gas storage and LNG infrastructure reveal fuel logistics networks.

**What it explains**

* Gas-fired power plant siting
* Industrial fuel supply chains
* Pipeline corridor clustering

**Expected overlap boost:** ★★★★☆

---

## ⭐ 3. **border_crossings_-_natural_gas**

**Why add:**
Shows major gas flow nodes entering the region.

**What it explains**

* Why emitters cluster along transmission corridors
* Energy logistics beyond pipelines alone

**Expected overlap boost:** ★★★★☆

---

## ⭐ 4. **aquifers**

**Why add:**
Large industrial facilities require substantial water access.

**What it explains**

* Cooling water availability
* Industrial siting near groundwater reserves
* Paper mills & chemical plant locations

**Expected overlap boost:** ★★★★☆

---

## ⭐ 5. **catchment**  *(watersheds & drainage basins)*

**Why add:**
Industrial corridors often follow watershed valleys.

**What it explains**

* Valley transport routes
* River corridor development patterns
* Historical industry siting logic

**Expected overlap boost:** ★★★☆☆

---

## ⭐ 6. **coastlines_(usace_ienc)** + **coastal_gages**

**Why add:**
Coastal industrial siting depends on marine access & water conditions.

**What it explains**

* Hampton Roads industrial clustering
* Ship channel & cooling water dependence
* Port-industry coupling

**Expected overlap boost:** ★★★☆☆

---

## ⚙️ Secondary (nice context, lower direct overlap)

### **biodiesel_plants**

Adds energy ecosystem context.

### **amtrak_stations**

Useful for transport context, but less industrial relevance.

### **base_flood_elevations**

Explains siting avoidance & industrial land constraints.

---

## 🧭 Why railroads looked so important

Rail ≠ coincidence.

Rail lines historically follow:

* river valleys
* coal seams
* industrial corridors
* port connections

Add the layers above and you’ll likely see:

**Energy + Water + Fuel + Transport = emitter geography**

---

## If you want the next level…

The single most powerful layer still missing (if available elsewhere):

**→ Electric transmission lines & substations**

That one often reveals the clearest clustering.

---

If you want, I can next:

✅ predict **which emitters will align with which new layers**
✅ help design **symbology to show the relationships**
✅ suggest **layer styling to avoid visual clutter**
✅ explain the Southwest VA vs Hampton Roads patterns

This map is already telling a story — these layers will make it *speak clearly*.
